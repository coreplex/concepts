Bundles
-------
A "Bundles" package would serve as a base for an extension-based PHP application.

The package itself should be able to install, un-install, activate and de-active a "bundle", through use of the file system. Other drivers may be included, and it should allow the developer to provide an open extension platform to anyone who may wish to extend their application.
