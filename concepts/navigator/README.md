# Navigator

A navigation package that will allow users to set navigation items in a config file. They should also be able to add a filter to navigation items so that they can restrict who can view the item. This should also handle active states for the navigation items.

The package should also contain renderers so that the user can set a view in the config and then render it where ever they need to in their application.
