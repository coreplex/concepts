# Cart
A "Cart" package would provide a means to store session data about a customer on an e-commerce website. They should be able to add items to their basket, view these these items, and be able to remove them.

The package itself should hold information about tax, shipping costs, pricing, quantity, product imagery and anything else that an e-commerce website might need from a basket library.
